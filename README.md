BioSim is a simulation software that models and simulates the ecosystem of Rossum√∏ya Island.
The ecosystem consists of four different types of landscapes:
- Water
- Desert
- Lowland
- Highland

And two species of animals:
- Herbivores
- Carnivores

Certain conditions and rules dictate the characteristics and behavior of the geography and animals
as time progresses on the island. The software simulates these dynamics, and visualizes the changes 
in real-time.

The software is built in Python 3.8. The software package includes Python modules, examples running the
simulation, and documentation for the software package.
